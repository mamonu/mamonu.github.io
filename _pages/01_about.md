  [Life costs and food survey project](https://github.com/ONSBigData/LCF-project)
  
  [Zoopla text classification project](https://github.com/ONSBigData/housing_clf)
  

- Currently involved in data science projects using PySpark 2+ on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench 
  environment on CDH (Cloudera's software distribution containing Apache Hadoop , Hive, YARN , Spark) 
  and related opensource projects.
  [not availiable in a public repository]
