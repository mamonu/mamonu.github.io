```markdown

Interested at the intersection of 

Statistics / Computer Science/ Machine Learning / Data Visualization

- Interests
  - Distributed Computing and programming
  - Data Science on cluster platforms (Spark/HDFS/Hadoop/YARN/PySpark/Hive/Impala)
  - NLP 
  - Python (especially functional programming on python)
  - Graph Databases. Graph/Network Theory
  - Clustering methods. And projection methods to bring info into 2d!
  - Visualization (mainly web based interactive but also 3D based!!)
  - Testing (from unit to integration to end-to-end). I love pytest and its plugins
  - profiling and finding ways to run code faster (a remnant from my C++ days!)
  - Lisp-family functional languages such as Clojure
  - Functional Languages in general (monads/monoids and other interesting topics)

```

some projects:


- Currently being involved projects using NLP (natural language processing) 
  techniques for text mining of unstructured documents and automatic document summarization and classification.
  
  [bumblebee python package](https://github.com/mamonu/bumblebee)
  
  [Life costs and food survey project](https://github.com/ONSBigData/LCF-project)
  
  [Zoopla text classification project](https://github.com/ONSBigData/housing_clf)
  

- Currently involved in data science projects using PySpark 2+ on the Cloudera Data Science Workbench 
  environment on CDH (Cloudera's software distribution containing Apache Hadoop , Hive, YARN , Spark) 
  and related opensource projects.
  [not availiable in a public repository]
  
- Have been working on a project involving NOSQL Graph databases (Neo4j) and researching the ways
  they can improve on existing data matching practices at the ONS.
  
  [A graph linkage interactive viz in Shiny](https://mamonu.shinyapps.io/GraphRecordLinkage/)

- A lunch-talk I was supposed to give at GDSP Conference 2018 but that day I was snowed in... (doh!)
