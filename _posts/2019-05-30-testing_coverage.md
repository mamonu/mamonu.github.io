# Using pytest 
## ... and creating a testing coverage report from it  üêû

<br />

## testing with pytest 
<br /> 

Today I will try to show a practical demo of using pytest.

Furthermore I will show we can be also produce coverage information in the form of an html report from the the pytest testing suite.

Initially i will install the pytest package if its not installed together with the coverage pytest plugin by running on a bash shell

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

Ok. now we have our coverage plugin for pytest installed so lets create a little boring demo.

i create a directory and create a python file inside it.There I create the function

If it receives input of no length (so something like '') then it returns something grumpily
otherwise if it receives input of length less than 3 it returns something else grumpily.
Finaly if the length its more than 3 then it does something else with the input.


The main code called rather unimaginatively covdemo.py :  

<br />

<br /> 


I also create a test file in the same directory called test_covdemo.py . Here is the test code in all its grace and beauty 

![calc app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamonu/mamonu.github.io/master/assets/hypt/covdemotest.png)


When I create this test I import the file that I created before.
In order to get a clearer picture I print the internals of what I imported in order to see
that I picked the function that I want to test.

I do this by:

```
print(dir(covtest))
```

I get from this the following and from what I see my function 'howmanyletters' has been picked up by the import.Great!!!!

```
['__builtins__', '__cached__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__', '__package__', '__spec__', 'howmanyletters', 'pytest']
```

## test discoverability
<br /> 

There is a reason why i called my test file and my test functions in this way. By calling a file test_* or *_test i ensure this file gets autocollected by pytest when I eventually run it. Furthermore by call 
calling my testing functions test_something or test_something_else inside my test_something.py file those tests get picked up. 
Pytest will only execute whatever function has test* or *test in it so that when running the tests the

```
print(dir(covtest))
``` 
statement will be ignored.

## run the test/tests 

<br /> 

ok its time to run my tests. I save and exit from my programming environment and go to the terminal.
There I put the following on the bash prompt

```
pytest -v
``` 

(-v is for verbose by the way)

![calc app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mamonu/mamonu.github.io/master/assets/hypt/cov-pytest-v1.png)

Yay. pytest found my test_covtest.py file and also my test_no_letters function. It run the test ... the test passed
And I got a [PASSED] in glorious green color. Life is good :)

## testing coverage


<br /> 


Test coverage measures the percentage covered area to test the feature/functionality. 
It includes information about which parts of a program are actually executed when running our test suite to 
determine whether all the corners of program has been covered/executed.

<br /> 

What Test Coverage does

* Finding area of a requirement not implemented by a set of test cases

* Helps to create additional test cases to increase coverage

* Identifying meaningless test cases that do not increase coverage
